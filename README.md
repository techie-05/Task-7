Support Vector Machines (SVM)🎯 🤖 🔧⚙️ 📊 

Summary 

This initiative concentrates on binary classification with the SVM model. The dataset is meticulously organized, and various kernels (linear and RBF) are examined. Tuning hyperparameters guarantees peak model performance, while cross-validation offers a reliable assessment. 🚀 

Procedures Involved 

1️⃣ Load and prepare the dataset for processing 

2️⃣ Train SVM with linear and RBF kernels. 

3️⃣ Adjust hyperparameters (C & gamma) for optimal outcomes 

4️⃣ Assess model effectiveness through cross-validation 

Findings & Perspectives
